                information that identifies, relates to, describes, references, is capable of being associated with, or

            <p><span>Non Personal Information.</span> As used in this Privacy Notice, “Non-Personal Information” means
                information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally and may include: (a)
                certain [A1]publicly available information; (b) aggregate information, meaning data about a group or
                category of services or users from which individual identities and other Personal Information has been
                removed; (c) deidentified information that cannot be easily linked back to the individual; or (d)

                Business Associate is PHI, we will take appropriate steps to comply with HIPAA’s privacy and security
                rule requirement with respect to any such use and disclosure.</p>

                consent; or (b) [A4]as authorized or required by law. We will limit the collection of Personal

            <p>Cookies. Like most commercial websites, we use cookies to track use of our Site. Cookies are small text
                files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your
